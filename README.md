👋 Hi, I’m Fengze

- 🎓 Master’s student at **Cornell Tech** It’s been about 4 months since I arrived here, and I’m still actively exploring NYC — a city that’s complex, intense, and strangely inspiring.

- 🌱 This term’s top 3
  1. Figure out what I genuinely want to work on (not just what looks “correct”)
  2. Keep pushing beyond my comfort zone — doing things I used to hesitate about
  3. Find an **internship or a research assistant** opportunity

- 🎯 Short-term
  - Contribute consistently to open-source communities  
  - Explore language-related research and technologies  
  - Keep discovering the city and settling into life here  

- 🌆 Long-term
  - Contribute to cities  
  - Use technology to help people  
  - Stay happy & healthy  

- ⚡ Fun fact: Turns out NYC is great — **just very expensive**.
